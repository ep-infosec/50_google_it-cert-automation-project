## Part 2: Automate text file processing and use webservices

This exercise lets you practice processing a bunch of files and then sending
the contents you processed to a webservice.

The code included here sets up the Django webserver so that you can interact
with it.  We **strongly recommend** not running this on your local
installation. Instead, you should run it inside a VM.

The `setup.sh` script will prepare the machine for the exercise. You can then
practice writing the necessary code.
