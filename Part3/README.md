## Part 3: Automate PDF generation and email sending

This exercise lets you practice generating a PDF with information and then
sending that PDF by email.

The `setup.sh` script will install and configure Roundcube webmail, so that you
can access the emails that are sent locally.  **This is not intended to be used
on your local machine**, but on a VM.  Alternatively, you can skip the Roundcube
setup and simply modify the email sending scripts to work with your email
setup.

The scripts included in the `scripts` directory can be used to generate PDFs
and send them by email, regardless of which email solution you're using.
